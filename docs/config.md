1. `subfolder_name`: the name of subfolder in the input/output folder containing organs `.nii.gz` files. For example:
    ```
    INPUT / OUTPUT (--input_folder / --output_folder)
    └── case_001
        └── segmentations <- (subfolder_name)
                ├── liver.nii.gz
                ...
                └── veins.nii.gz
    ```

2. `class_map`: the label mapping dict of organ and their labels.
    > [!WARNING]
    > This parameter will be deprecated soon.

    All organs on this list will be read and loaded, but only the ones listed in target_organs will be processed by ShapeKit.

3. `target_organs`: the organs selected for postprocessing. 

    By adding or deleting the organs listed, you can choose which organs you want to process. For example:
    ```
        target_organs:
            - bladder
            - colon
            - duodenum
            - femur
            - intestine
            - kidney
            - liver
            - lung
            - pancreas
    ```


4. `organ_adjacency_map`: a dictionary used in the `reassign_false_positives` function. 
    
   This section identifies organs that sit close together where the AI might mislabel a border. By listing these anatomical neighbors, you help the software distinguish between touching structures—like the liver and pancreas—to ensure your results are accurate.

    Exmaple:
    ```
    organ_adjacency_map:
        lung_left: [postcava]
        lung_right: [postcava]
        liver: [kidney_right, pancreas]
    ```

    This means that during segmentation:
	(1) Parts of the predicted `lung_left` may be false positives that actually belong to `postcava`.
    (2) Similarly, `liver` may mistakenly include areas from `kidney_right` or `pancreas`.

    **Note: This map is one-directional**, i.e., if `lung_left` → `postcava` is defined, it does not imply the reverse (`postcava` → `lung_left`). This directionality reflects common misclassification patterns, not anatomical symmetry.

5. `affine_reference_file_name`: file to load affine reference info.

6. `if_save_combined_label`: boolean parameter that controls whether to save the combined labels as a .nii.gz file after processing. For example:

    ```
    OUTPUT
    └── case_001
        ├── combined_labels.nii.gz <- (if_save_combined_label)
        └── segmentations
                ├── liver.nii.gz
                ...
                └── veins.nii.gz
    ```
7. `vertebrae_engine`: which vertebrae module to run. `shapekit` (default)
   is the existing mask-based module. `shapekit_levels` renumbers the levels
   when the model names them wrong: it cuts the column at the disc gaps,
   numbers the vertebrae between them in order, and rewrites only the labels
   that disagree, leaving consistent ones exactly as predicted. It uses the
   case CT when one is reachable and still runs without it.
   `shapekit_pro` is the evidence-gated
   engine that repairs vertebra labels against the case CT by recoloring
   inside the prediction envelope (no deletion of predicted bone); it
   requires the case CT and falls back to `shapekit` when the CT is absent.

8. `ct_file_name` / `ct_root`: how `shapekit_pro` finds the CT. The engine
   first looks for `<input_case>/<ct_file_name>`; when `ct_root` is set it
   also tries `<ct_root>/<case_id>/<ct_file_name>`.
